        This model called "basic" calculates the amount of crystal (in fraction) as a function of the amount of cooling
        as suggested by Harris and Rowland (2001).
        It take into account the amount of crystallization during the eruption that occurred between the eruption
        temperature and the solid temperature (temperature at which the material cannot flow anymore)

        Input data
        -----------
        json file containing:
        initial crystal_fraction,
        crystals_grown_during_cooling,
        solid_temperature
        eruption_temperature

        the crystallization rate in fraction of crystals per degree
