    """ This method "bimodal" considers two regimes for calculating the temperature of the crust following
        the suggestions of Harris and Rowland (2015):

         Between the vent and a given distance the crust temperature is calculated as a function of time
         according to Hon et al. (1994) and after this given distance the crust temperature is constant
         and equals to the input value.

         Hon et al. (1994) equation is :

         crust_temperature = a*log(time) + b

         where time is in hours and a (=-140) and b (=303.) are fit parameters. This equation implies implicitly that the initial crust
         temperature is  1070°C.

         Warning, this model should not be used for other cases than Hawaiian cases as the Hon model is an empirical
         relationship determined from Hawaiian flows.

        Input data
        -----------
        json file containing the crust_temperature

        variables
        -----------
         time that must be set as 1s at distance = 0 in the json file and then is calculated down flow
        new_time = time + (step / v_mean)

        Returns
        ------------
        crust temperature in K
