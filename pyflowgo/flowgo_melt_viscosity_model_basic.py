    where the viscosity is calculated via Dragoni (1989)

    viscosity(Pa.s)(T) = viscosity_eruption * a(eruption_temperature -  core_temperature),

    -----------

    variables
    -----------
    temperature of the lava interior : core_temperature

    Returns
    ------------
    the viscosity of the pure melt in Pa.s
