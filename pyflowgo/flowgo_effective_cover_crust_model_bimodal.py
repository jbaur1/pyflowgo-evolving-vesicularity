    """ This method allows to compute the effective cover crust  (then used to calculate the radiation)
    as a function of v_mean downslope where "bimodal" allows to change the effective crust cover values after a
    given distance as suggested in Harris and Rowland (2015)
    This method "bimodal" allows to calculate the effective cover fraction (f_crust) as a function of velocity fallowing
    Harris & Rowland (2001):
    f_crust = fc * math.exp(alpha * v_mean)

    where fc is the crust_cover_fraction that is either equals to 1 or is comprise between 0 and 1

    and alpha changes after a given distance, as usggested by Harris & Rowland (2015)
    For For Mauna Loa 1859 before 10 km fc = 0.9023 and alpha = –0.04778 (poorly crusted) and after 10 km
    ,fc =0.9023, alpha = =–0.03652 (more heavily crusted)


    Input data
    -----------
    from the json file:
    the critical distance and the two alpha values


    Returns
    ------------
    the effective crust cover fraction
