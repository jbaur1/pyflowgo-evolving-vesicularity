    """
    This function calculates the effect of crystal cargo on viscosity according to the original FLOWGO
    from Harris and Rowland 2001 who used the Einstein-Roscoe relationship (as first introduced by Shaw, 1965):

    relative_viscosity = math.pow((1. - R * phi), - 2.5)

    where R = 1.51 as suggested by Pinkerton and Stevenson (1992)
    This relationship applies only for spherical solid particles.

    Input data
    -----------
    the inverse of the maximum packing for spherical particles (1/phimax = r = 1.51)

    variables
    -----------
    crystal fraction: phi

    Returns
    ------------
    the relative viscosity due to the crystal cargo
