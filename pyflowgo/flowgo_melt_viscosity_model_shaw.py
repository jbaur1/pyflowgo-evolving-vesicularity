    """ This function calculates the viscosity of teh melt according to Shaw et al. 1972:

    ln viscosity(Poise) = slope*(10000/T(K))-(1.5*slope)-6.4

    where slope is the intercept calculated from the chemical composotion of the silicate liquid

    Input data
    -----------
    json file containing the shaw_slope in melt_viscosity_parameters

    variables
    -----------
    temperature of the lava interior : core_temperature

    Returns
    ------------
    the viscosity of the pure melt in Pa.s
