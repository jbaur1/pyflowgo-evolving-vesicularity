    """
    This method  "hon" allows the crust temperature to decrease downflow as a function of time via the model of Hon et al.
        (1994) and as suggested by Harris and Rowland (2015):

        crust_temperature = -140 * math.log(time) + 303 where time is in hours

         where time is in hours. This equation implies implicitly that
         the initial crust temperature is 1070Â°C.

         Warning, this model should not be used for other cases than Hawaiian cases as the Hon model is an empirical
         relationship determined from Hawaiian flows.

        Input data
        -----------
        json file containing the crust_temperature

        variables
        -----------
        time that must be set as 1s at distance = 0 in the json file and then is calculated down flow
        new_time = time + (step / v_mean)

        Returns
        ------------
        crust temperature in K
